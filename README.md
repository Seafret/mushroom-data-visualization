# mushroom-data-visualization
For a quick link to the visualization, go to: https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~jarogi/cpsc583finalproject/

This was a project for my data visualization course. I took a subset of a data set that described characterists of mushrooms and labelled them as edible or poisonous, and then with that subset of data I made a visalization.

In the visualization I made a line for each mushroom and that line went through all the characteristics associated with it.
I coloured the line red if it was a poisonous mushroom and green if it was an edible mushroom.
The user can hover over a green or red line to see all lines with that same colour.
Alternatively, the user can click on a characteristic to see all lines that go through that particular characteristic.
Additionally, if a user hovers over a characteristic icon, the name for that icon will appear beside it's category.

This project was done using the D3 library.
